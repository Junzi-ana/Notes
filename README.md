# Notes



Mainly notes written during my PhD years, including statistics, stochastic and analysis topics, maybe machine learning in future.



I personally recommend that open these .md files as a whole repo in obsidian, whose double-link is available. Notice that some references are NOT provided due to copyright issues.



For better reading experiences, all the essential plugins are listed here, please install and set them properly:



* colored tags
* list callouts
* multi properties
* note status
* simple columns
* tikzjax



These README may not update in time, so please contact me if there are any problems. Academic discussion is warmly welcomed.
